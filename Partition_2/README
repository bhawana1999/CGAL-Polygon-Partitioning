y_monotone_partition_2.cpp
------------------------------------

computes a y-monotone partition of a random polygon and checks that each 
polygon produced is, in fact, y-monotone and that the polygons form a 
partition of the original polygon.

approx_convex_partition_2.cpp
---------------------------------------------

computes an approximately optimal convex partition of a random polygon and 
checks the validity of the partition afterwards.

greene_approx_convex_partition_2.cpp
----------------------------------------------------

computes an approximately optimal convex partition of a random polygon using 
Greene's approximation algorithm and checks the validity of the partition 
afterwards.

optimal_convex_partition_2.cpp
----------------------------------------------

Computes an optimal convex partition of a particular polygon and checks the 
validity of the partition afterwards.
